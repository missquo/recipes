Kerbey Lane Cafe's Tomato Pie

4 large tomatoes, peeled and thickly sliced

10 fresh basil leaves, chopped

2 green onions, white and green parts chopped

Salt and pepper

1/3 cup nonfat Greek yogurt

1/3 cup crumbled feta cheese

1/3 cup mayonnaise

Kalamata olives, chopped

Pre-baked savory pie crust (store-bought or homemade from your favorite recipe)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place the tomatoes in a colander in the sink in one layer. Sprinkle with salt and allow to drain for 10 minutes.

Press the sliced tomatoes between layers of paper towels to remove some of the juice.

Cut the tomatoes into large pieces, then mix together with the basil and onions in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper.

Combine the yogurt, feta and mayonnaise together in another bowl. Put the tomato mixture into the pre-baked pie shell then spread the yogurt mixture on top and bake for 30 minutes or until lightly browned. Let cool for at least 15 minutes. Cut into slices and serve warm with a sprinkling of Kalamata olives.
